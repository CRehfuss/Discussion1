### Getting Started:

#### To begin the project you must clone this repository. On the top of this page there is a green "clone or download" button. Copy the github link from here. Then type the following command into your terminal: 

git clone *git://copied.url.git*

You should notice that the folder from git is now on your local machine, called *p1-starter-code*. You will learn more about git basics and how to use the platform in the first discussion.
